*What is the question you hope to answer?*
How do I accurately detect that an intrusion is actually occurring rather than just an out-of-bound normal activity?  How can I predict with accuracy that this anomalous activity is actually an intrusion?

*What data are you planning to use to answer that question?*
Given the sensitive nature of network security breaches, and the time constraints, I am using research databases for my study. I will have to select one of them for my study. The most promising ones are from:

http://users.aber.ac.uk/pds7/csic_dataset/csic2010http.html

*What do you know about the data so far?*
The dataset consists primarily of text logs from web servers. Given that they are research databases, they have been labelled and are limited in size (<= 500MB).  None of these raw log files have been pre-processed.

*Why did you choose this topic?*
Nowadays, especially with prevalent and increasing use of cloud based computing, network security can no longer be taken for granted for any organization. My clients have experienced network security breaches. And the increasing use of cloud, only makes network attacks that much easier, faster, and cheaper to construct, and execute.

There are a lot of tools that can be used to address and mitigate network security breaches. An intrusion detection system is one such system. And this study will be an exercise in understanding the predictive analytics used in an anomaly-based intrusion detection system.
